This project is to emulate the effects and predict the depth of penetration of uniform and non-uniform magnetic field and it's influence on neural network, in vivo.
This has been shown that magnetic stimulation can increase the rate of recovery og the neural tissue but the mechanism and extent of effect is unknown yet. Researcher adn clinicians have been working on introducing transcranial magnetic stimulation to recover patients who are suffering after stroke. This has been somehow successful but not knowing the mechanism of activity limited it's maturity. Now in the ara of computers and digital knoweledge, it's time to use computer modeling to design a simple neural network, introduce stimulation to it, record the resonses and compare it to the real results. This can help us predicting the effects of magnetic stimulation in the body, visualize it's effect over and different network and might be smal step towards helping many patients with central nervous system injuries.
